Over recent years there has been an enormous increase in the amount of air traffic
around the world resulting in various problems and a major cause
of this has been the growth of low-cost airlines
Although some people believe that taxes should be increased for air travel I disagree

Those that support taxing airlines believe that this will result in a reductio
in this type of travel and thus solve the problems of pollution noise and construction
This is because a tax would make the cost of travelling more expensive which will they claim
lead to a decrease in demand Proponents of this solution believe that taxes are fair because
everyone has to pay them and it is a workable solution that will have the additional
bonus of providing an income for the government
