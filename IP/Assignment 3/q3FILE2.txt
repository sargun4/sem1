Developments in technology over many years have dramatically changed the world that we live in,
and some people think that earlier advances in technology have had a greater impact on
and been more beneficial to the lives of ordinary people than more recent changes.
However, I partially agree with this as the advantages and influences on peopleâ€™s lives
actually depends on the particular area of technology.

There is no doubt that some earlier advances in technology have been very influential,
such as those related to technology around the home. Devices such as washing machines,
fridges and freezers, central heating, microwaves and televisions were invented many years ago,
and now nearly every household has all or some of these in their home, making life much easier.
Though they have been improved over time,
they still carry out much the same purpose as when they were first invented
